# herd immunity

## Inspiration
Inspired by the current situation and our own experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic, HERD IMMUNITY is a game to highlight some of the disparities in access to vaccines. With more and more people getting inoculated, weâ€™ve started to reconnect with friends and family again and communities have started to reopen. However, just as COVID-19 disproportionately affected people with lower socioeconomic status as well as racial/ethnic minorities, such disparities have persisted throughout vaccine availability (and also Selene's fire puns)

## What it does
HERD IMMUNITY provides a fun and playable model to show the disparities between communities in vaccine access. It's a game, allowing people across communities of all ages and ethnicities to play and understand. Empathy is a key part of connection and our game hopes to help players understand the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on people of low socioeconomic status. As recently vaccinated teens, we were inspired by the freedom and privilege to connect with friends and family we haven't seen in over a year.

## How we built it
We built this app using Unity, Blender, Krita, Figma. Frameworks used were .Net and mono.

## Challenges we ran into
Time was a huge challenge for us; we wanted to get a lot done in a very short amount of time. We put a lot of focus on perfecting the game itself leaving the video for a last minute scramble barely squeezing it out in the last couple minutes. Ultimately we also ran into some unprecedented bugs and internet struggles with uploading.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're really proud that we got a working model done that looks pretty cool! Also Selene is really happy we got to squeeze a "mOoOoo" into the video.

## What we learned
We learned to not bite off more than we can chew and have fun, as well as some new skills in Unity and Blender.

## What's next for HERD IMMUNITY
Fix bugs and getting others to play!
